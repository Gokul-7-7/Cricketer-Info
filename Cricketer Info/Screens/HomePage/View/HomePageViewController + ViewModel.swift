///capturelist
///When an object or value is getting referenced in an escaping closure it gets captured inside the scope for it to get used when the closure is executed.
///When an object get's captured (here 'self') it creates a strong reference which will make it retain and cause memory leaks and storng reference cycles or retain cycles
///Using [weak self] capture list, we capture self as a weak reference which will break our retain cycles
///While using self, we retaining it for as long as the closure is in memory.
///Using [weak self] is only required in situations where capturing self strongly would end up causing a retain cycle, for example when self is being captured within a closure thatâ€™s also ultimately retained by that same object.
